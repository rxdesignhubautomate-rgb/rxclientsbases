# RX Client CRM frontend v1.9.0 deployment

1. Deploy backend v2.9.0 first.
2. In Vercel, import this frontend project or upload the project files.
3. Set `CRM_API_BASE_URL=https://rxclientsbases.onrender.com/api/v1` for Production.
4. Redeploy without using an old build cache.
5. Sign out and sign in again so the refreshed session contains the current permissions.
6. Open **WhatsApp Inbox**, click **Enable alerts**, and allow browser notifications.
7. Open **Marketing** and click **Sync from Meta** before starting a campaign.

The campaign workflow is: **Draft → Submit → Approve → Schedule/Start**.

The client and campaign workspace is segmented automatically:

- Ankit sees Existing Clients.
- Reshu sees Prospects and Leads.
- Admin/Owner can select either customer type.
- Use **Create 500-contact campaign lists** to split a large segment into safe batches.
- Choose **Open 24h window only** for image, video, audio, or document drip steps. Closed customers wait until their next inbound WhatsApp reply; the CRM does not disguise marketing as Utility.

Only Meta templates with an **Approved** status can be used for template sends. Transactional update forms require real Firestore order or quotation IDs linked to the selected customer.

If an older backend is temporarily deployed, the frontend automatically uses legacy campaign routes and keeps the Marketing page available. Advanced policy controls activate after backend v7 is live.

Sales-user assignment is also non-blocking: a temporary `/users` failure will not blank the Marketing page.

## WhatsApp workspace

The matching backend enables media/voice notes, quoted replies, reactions, location and contact sharing, interactive quick-reply buttons, reusable quick replies, internal notes, assignment, tags, Important status, follow-ups, desktop alerts, and linked order updates.

The WhatsApp workspace is locked to the available browser height on desktop. The conversation list, message history, client workspace, and unusually tall Utility form scroll independently, so the Reply/Utility tabs, attachment tools, message field, and Send button remain visible.

Up to 10,000 conversation summaries and 10,000 messages total are cached in the browser's IndexedDB, with a 500-message maximum for any single conversation. Oldest cached records are evicted automatically. The inbox renders that cache immediately, then requests only changed conversations and new messages every five seconds while the tab is visible. The cache contains message metadata, not media file bytes; Firebase Storage remains the durable source for images and documents.

Browser microphone, location, and notification permissions are granted per device. WhatsApp Business App coexistence, calling, Flows, catalog/commerce, and payments still require separate Meta account setup and eligibility; deploying this frontend does not enable them.
